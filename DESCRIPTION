Description: This package can be used to estimate Social Security Benefits.
    But you need to supply wage data. If you don't have wage data, you can
    obtain your wage data by creating an account on the Social Security web
    site <https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount/> and click on the link to download
    your earning record. Estimating your Social Security benefit typically
    involves estimating future values for a number of parameters used in
    the calculation - Wages, Average Wage Indices, Contribution and Benefit
    Bases, and Cost of Living Adjustments must all be estimated to
    calculate an OASDI benefit. This package provides default estimators for
    those.
