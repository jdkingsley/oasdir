#' Return the \emph{National Average Wage Index} data set.
#'
#' The \emph{National Average Wage Index} is used to normalize wages across
#' different years. Wage indexing depends on the year in which a person is
#' first elgible to receive OASDI benefits. The year of first elgibility for
#' OASDI is at age 62. An individuals earnings are always indexed to the average
#' wage level two years prior to the year of first eligibility. This is called
#' the indexing year. Thus, for a person reaching age 62 in 2017, the personâ€™s
#' earnings would be indexed to the average wage index for 2015, which is the
#' indexing year. A table of \href{https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/COLA/awiseries.html}{Average Wage Indexes}
#' is available on the Social Security web site. This data set comes from there,
#' but it is not a real time fetch, so the data is current up to the time that
#' this package was created. In order to determine the Average Indexed Monthly
#' Earnings when the indexing year is beyond the last year in the AWI data, the
#' data is fit with a model which is used to project future wage index values.
#' If no endYear is provided the function returns the data set of measured values
#' without any projected values.

#' @param endYear the last year to include in the returned data set
#' @return the AWI data set
